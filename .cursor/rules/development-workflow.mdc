- **Runtime behavior**: The bot often keeps the process alive. Expect to terminate manually after 10-20 seconds when testing.
- **Manual shutdown**: Use `Ctrl+C` (SIGINT) or your process manager to stop development runs.
- **Testing**: Run `pnpm test` (Vitest). For runs that may hang, prefer `pnpm dev:autostop` which times out after 30 seconds.
- **Observability**: Inspect recent logs under `logs/` for debugging. Timestamped files capture the latest sessions.
- **Quality gates**: Use `pnpm lint`, `pnpm lint:fix`, `pnpm format`, and `pnpm format:write` to maintain code quality.
