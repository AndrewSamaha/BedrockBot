- **Domain focus**: This repository implements a Minecraft Bedrock bot. Design choices should respect Bedrock gameplay and protocol expectations.
- **Protocol references**: Consult the documentation in `docs/`, especially `docs/minecraft-protocols/data_documentation.pdf`, when handling packets.
- **Data samples**: Use `docs/log_samples/` for canonical examples of packet flows and player interactions.
- **Logging**: Bot runs emit timestamped JSON logs in `logs/`. Review them to understand behavior and diagnose issues.
- **Key dependencies**: Code integrates `bedrock-protocol`, Prismarine libraries, and LangChain-based integrations. Respect their abstractions instead of reimplementing core logic.
